Thoughts/Challenges

Provider/IaC: I chose AWS for a cloud provider, as that is what Murmuration uses, and Terraform for IaC. Terraform's declarative syntx
and easy integration of scripts makes it an attractive choice.
Static content vs Python application: The website for this application is essentially a robust README. The application's functionality
is utilized from command line. So I decided to host the static site in an s3 bucket while deploying the actual applicaiton to an 
linux EC2 machine.
Requirements: Lite LLM required a higher version of openai than specified by the requirements.txt file. I handled this by updating the
requirements.txt file in the bootstrap shell script that runs with Terraform. 
Testing CI pipeline: I wanted to make a fully functional config filehe build takes up more storage than is granted by CiecleCI's 
free tier, so I had to rely entirely on pseudocode. Additionally, the size of Docker container needed for part of the build is not
available on CircleCi's free tier.
